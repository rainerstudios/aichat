## 💬 **Example User Interaction Flows**

### **Server Configuration**

```
👤 "Change my Minecraft server to creative mode"
🤖 "I'll help you switch to creative mode. This will change the gamemode to creative in server.properties and allow players to build freely. Should I proceed with this change?"
👤 "Yes"
🤖 "✅ Server switched to creative mode. The change will take effect after the next restart. Would you like me to restart the server now?"
```

### **Advanced Troubleshooting**

```
👤 "My Rust server keeps crashing with memory errors"
🤖 "I can see your server is using 95% of allocated RAM. Let me check your configuration and recent logs. I found several issues:
1. Map size too large for allocated memory
2. High plugin count causing memory leaks
3. No automatic restarts configured

I recommend reducing map size from 4000 to 3000 and enabling 6-hour restarts. Should I make these changes?"
```

### **Multi-Game Management**

```
👤 "Switch my server from Vanilla Minecraft to Paper"
🤖 "I'll help you switch to Paper for better performance and plugin support. This process will:
1. Create a backup of your current server
2. Download the latest Paper build
3. Migrate your world and configurations
4. Preserve all player data

This will take about 5-10 minutes. Should I proceed?"
